    <h1>A platform disintermediating the media industries!</h1>
    <p>Welcome netizens! This protocol is meant to empower you as a content creator, curator, producer and anything you can think of in between, create or want the world to know.
    </p>
    
    <p>We aim at making the participants to the information economy to interact directly again, and the information to flow as the early internet once made us
        think of what it could be.
    </p>
    
    <p>To start, anyone can choose to paticipate as an investor, a content provider or just to access contents created through
        this decentralized, peer-to-peer protocol. 
        
        We are focusing on introducing trustless aspects and an economical design that gets rid of the data eaters and advertisements business model, using DeFi instead of 
        you as a lab rat whose behavior is the target ot the... well you know them :)</p>
    <p>
        You can now collaborate in creating rich content productions, without having to trust a single source of content, and we will refine the protocol so you can define more and more your own rules!
    </p>
